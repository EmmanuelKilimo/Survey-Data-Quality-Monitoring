## OVERSEEING SURVEY IMPLEMENTATION


# An Education NGO is implementing a subsidised school-lunch and parental support programme to promote learning outcomes of children, targeting particularly Grade 1 to Grade 3 students in Tanzania. 


# The programme is currently being tested through an impact evaluation involving a group of 30 participant schools, as well as a set of 30 control schools that will receive the program at a later stage. The endline evaluation involves collecting data from schools over a  one-month period, focusing on measuring childrenâ€™s learning as proxied by the Early Grade Reading and Mathematics Assessments tools. 



# In this assignment, we have a dataset coming from the first two days of data collection. 

## The tasks are as follows:

# 1. Identify follow-up actions before the data collection resumes: Your first task is to check the incoming data and survey tool programmed by a coding team and catch any notable errors that may compromise data quality going forward. 
 
# 2. Provide preliminary analysis on attrition rates and sample balance: Your second task is to prepare a table showing comparing mean age, Mathematics and English test scores, gender  ratios,  and  sample  sizes  of  students  in  the  Treatment  and  Control  samples respectively. 
 
# The two provided datasets were reviewed and analyzed

## The  shared  materials  highlight  a  set  of  key  mistakes  that  may  indicate  issues  with implementation of the fieldwork or tool design that you should detect
